🚀 Multiple Client-Server Program in C++ 💻
Overview 📝
Welcome to our super cool multiple client-server program implemented in C++! 🎉 It's got all the bells and whistles you need for a seamless communication experience. Just fire it up, and watch the magic happen! ✨

Features 🌟

Multiple Client Support: The server can handle connections from multiple clients concurrently. 🤝

Broadcast Messaging: Send a message from the server, and it magically gets broadcasted to all connected clients. 📣

Simple Implementation: Keep it simple, keep it smooth. Our codebase is as easy as a breeze to understand. 🌀

Prerequisites 🛠️

C++ Compiler: Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. 🖥️

Standard Library: No need to fuss about external dependencies. We keep it classy with standard C++ libraries. 📚

Usage 🚀

Compile the Server and Client Files: Fire up your terminal and let's get compiling!

g++ server.cpp -o server

g++ client.cpp -o client

Run the Server: Ready, set, go! Launch that server like a champ.

./server

Connect Clients: Time to bring in the squad. Connect those clients and let the party begin!

./client

Interact with the Program: Start chatting away! Send messages, receive replies, and bask in the glory of seamless communication.
Exit the Program: All good things must come to an end. When you're ready to bid adieu, simply type exit or hit Ctrl+C.
